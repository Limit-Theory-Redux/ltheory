/// Controls the size of a [`Window`]
///
/// ## Physical, logical and requested sizes
///
/// There are three sizes associated with a window:
/// - the physical size,
/// which represents the actual height and width in physical pixels
/// the window occupies on the monitor,
/// - the logical size,
/// which represents the size that should be used to scale elements
/// inside the window, measured in logical pixels,
/// - the requested size,
/// measured in logical pixels, which is the value submitted
/// to the API when creating the window, or requesting that it be resized.
///
/// ## Scale factor
///
/// The reason logical size and physical size are separated and can be different
/// is to account for the cases where:
/// - several monitors have different pixel densities,
/// - the user has set up a pixel density preference in its operating system,
/// - the LTR `App` has specified a specific scale factor between both.
///
/// The factor between physical size and logical size can be retrieved with
/// [`WindowResolution::scale_factor`].
///
/// For the first two cases, a scale factor is set automatically by the operating
/// system through the window backend. You can get it with
/// [`WindowResolution::base_scale_factor`].
///
/// For the third case, you can override this automatic scale factor with
/// [`WindowResolution::set_scale_factor_override`].
///
/// ## Requested and obtained sizes
///
/// The logical size should be equal to the requested size after creating/resizing,
/// when possible.
/// The reason the requested size and logical size might be different
/// is because the corresponding physical size might exceed limits (either the
/// size limits of the monitor, or limits defined in [`WindowResizeConstraints`]).
///
/// Note: The requested size is not kept in memory, for example requesting a size
/// too big for the screen, making the logical size different from the requested size,
/// and then setting a scale factor that makes the previous requested size within
/// the limits of the screen will not get back that previous requested size.
