# License Information for Limit-Theory-Redux

## License Overview

This repository contains content with mixed licensing based on its origin:

### 1. Original Content from Limit Theory
- **All content** (code, assets, documentation, etc.) directly derived from or substantially similar to Josh Parnell's original Limit Theory project remains under **The Unlicense** and is effectively in the public domain.

### 2. New Contributions and Substantial Modifications
- **All new content**, substantial modifications, and new creative additions to the Limit Theory Redux project are generally **dual-licensed** under the **Apache License 2.0** and **MIT License**.
- **Exceptions**: Content that is marked with a specific licensing header or license file located in the file's directory as described in the License Identification section below (e.g., music contributed by artists using a Creative Commons License).

## License Identification Method

This repository primarily uses an origin-based licensing approach for all files. However:

- Where explicit clarity is needed, individual files may contain license headers or notices specifying their exact license
- Some key files or particularly mixed files may be explicitly marked with appropriate headers
- License files located in a file's directory may specify the license for all content in that directory/or specific files in a directory
- In the absence of explicit file notices or directory license files, the origin of the content determines its license as described above

In cases of ambiguity or for particularly important content, we may add explicit license information to provide additional clarity.

## Determining License for Specific Files

When working with files in this repository:

1. Check for explicit license headers within the file
2. Check for license files in the file's directory that may apply to all content in that directory/or specific files in a directory
3. If neither exists, determine if the content originates from the original Limit Theory (Unlicense) or is a new contribution (Apache 2.0/MIT)
4. For questions about specific file licensing, please open an issue in the repository

## Previous Contributions

Code contributed to this project before the establishment of the dual Apache 2.0/MIT licensing remains under the copyright of the original contributors and under the original license terms that were in effect at the time of contribution.

No attempt is made by this NOTICE to change or modify the licensing terms of these previous contributions without explicit consent from the copyright holders.

## Original Project Acknowledgment
