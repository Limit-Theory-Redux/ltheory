# NOTICE

## Licensing Information

This repository (Limit-Theory-Redux) contains content with mixed licensing based on its origin:

1. **Original Content from Limit Theory**
   - All content (code, assets, documentation, etc.) directly derived from or substantially similar to Josh Parnell's original Limit Theory project remains under The Unlicense and is effectively in the public domain.
   
2. **New Contributions and Substantial Modifications**
   - All new content, substantial modifications, and new creative additions to the Limit Theory Redux project are dual-licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and MIT License.

## License Identification

This repository primarily uses an origin-based licensing approach for all files. However:

- Where explicit clarity is needed, individual files may contain license headers or notices specifying their exact license
- Some key files or particularly mixed files may be explicitly marked with appropriate headers
- In the absence of explicit file notices, the origin of the content determines its license as described above

In cases of ambiguity or particularly important content, we may add explicit license information to provide additional clarity.

## Previous Contributions

Code contributed to this project before the establishment of the dual Apache 2.0/MIT licensing remains under the copyright of the original contributors and under the original license terms that were in effect at the time of contribution.

No attempt is made by this NOTICE to change or modify the licensing terms of these previous contributions without explicit consent from the copyright holders.

## Original Project Acknowledgment

This project is a community continuation of Limit Theory, originally developed by Josh Parnell. The original content was released into the public domain under The Unlicense.

## License Selection for Dual-Licensed Content
